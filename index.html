- JavaScript codes can be run inside of a browser or a Node.
- Browsers and Nodes provide a runtime environtment to JavaScript code.
- Every browser has a JavaScript engine.
- Node is a C++ program includes Google's V8 JavaScript Engine. 
- So we can run JavaScript code outside of the browser.
- ECMAScript is a specification. 
- JavaScript is a programming language that confirms to that specification. 
- ECMA organization is responsible for defining standarts.

- If we want to try small scripts on the browser. 
- We can easily write down the scripts to inspect element-> Console screen in the browser.

- Live server, in vs code tools, is a lightweight webserver and we use it for seving our web application.

        Hi, this the first study of Gizem.

    <!--
    - As a best practice we should add the our JavaScript codes at the end of the body section in between <script></script> tags.
    - We use html for the content and JavaScript for the behaviour. 
    - So we should seperate these from each other(Seperation of Concerns). 
    - To be able to do that we need to create a js file and forward the behavioural part of the html file(between script tags) to the new js file(in our cas it is index.js). 
    - After that we should indicate our new index.js file will be used in index.html file in the script tags.

        // send this line to JavaScript code - console.log('This my first log on the console!');
